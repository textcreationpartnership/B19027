            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Whereas Wee understand, that Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> takes upon him (without any legall authoritie or power) to issue Warrants to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables, and other Our Officers, to raise divers of our trained Bands of this Our Countrey, and requires them to march with their armes, and to come into our Towne of <hi>Hull,</hi> where hee hath disarmed divers of them, keeps their arms and discharges the men, and whereas Wee are credibly, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that divers persons, who were lately Colonels, Lievteant-Collonels, Captains, and Officers of the trained Bands of this our County, intend shortly to summon, and endeavour to muster the forces of this our County: For as much as by the Law of the Land, none of our trained Bands are to be raised or mustered, upon any pretence or authority whatsoever, but by speciall warrant under our own hand, or by a Legall Writ directed to the Sheriffe of the County, or by Warrant from the Lord Livetenant, or Deputy-Lievtenants of the County, appointed and authorized by Commission under our great Seale. And whereas at present there is no Lord Lievtenant or Deputy-lievtenant legally authorized to commmand the forces and trained Bands of this our County of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the Commissions, Command, and Power of all Collonels, Lievtenant Collonels, Captains and Officers of our trained Bands, (which were derived from the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Power of the Lord-Lievtenant only) are now actually void, and of no force and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Our will and command therefore is, that you forthwith issue Warrants under your hand, to all the late Collonels, Lievtenant-Collonels, Captaines and Officers, who (whiles the Lord Lievtenant, Commission was in force) had the command of the trained Bands of this our county: And also to all High and Petty Constables, and other Our Officers, in this Our County, whom it may concerne; charging and commanding them, and every of them, in Our Name, and upon their Allegiance, and as they tender the Peace of this our Kingdome, not to Muster, Leavie, or Raise, or to Summon, or Warne (upon any Pretence or Directions whatsoever) any of Our trained Bands to Rise, Muster, or March, without expresse Warrant under Our Hand, or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from you Our Sheriffe grounded upon a particular Writ to that purpose; which Wee also command you, not to put in Execution without Our Privity and Allowance, whiles We shall reside in this Our County. And in case any of Our trained Bands shall rise, or gather together, contrary to this our Command, Then We will and command you to charge and require them, to dissolve, and retire to their dwellings. And if upon due Summons from you, they shall not lay downe their Arms, aad depart to their dwellings; We will and command you, upon your Allegiance, and as you tender the peace and quiet of this Our Kingdome, to raise the Power of the County, and suppresse them by force, as the LaW hath directed and given you Power to doe. And to the end that this Our expresse Command may be notified to all Our good Subjects in this Our County, so as none may pretend hereafter to have beene misled through ignorance; We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you to cause these Our Letters to be forthwith read, and published openly in all Churches and Parishes in this our Countie. Herein you may not faile, as you tender the safety and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Our Person, the good and peace of this Our Kingdome, and will answer the contrary at your perill. For which this shall be your sufficient Warrant.</p>
